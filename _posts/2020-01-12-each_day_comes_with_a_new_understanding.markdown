**Code while on Breaks!**

It's being three weeks of extensive coding with two week of christmas break (the break I wish never came but anyways we move ). I struggled getting back to understanding my codes and how they worked , getting it, worked really hard with a lot of help from ask a question , I was able to get  this week, the current week of resumption seems super busy for AAQ coaches, since  everyone back and trying to figure things out just like me
Also, I finanly got my local enviroment set up , this makes me feel good at least , although everything is still new to me but its all about learning for me right now .

**Reckoning Week**

I am super nervous of the coming week , because the week determines alot of things about my relevant in the program and I actually feel like I do not know what I'm doing, but something also tell me "I will be fine" . I have tried to reach out to a couple of people in my cohort(student) just to get someone to talk to about the project but everyone seems uptight pretty much , which I had toi tell my self its okay.

The week each student will turn in a  **** FINAL CLI PROJECT****  built from the scratch . Pretty much , I am scrared since I actually don't know what to do but hopefully I will turn in something good by the end of the week.

Goodluck to eveyone!
