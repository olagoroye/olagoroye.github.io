This very question I have had to ask myself several times , the answered that came to me is why not software development. In the quest of finding what  I can be best at, I have found myself wanting to be a Nurse (which I have all of my pre-class and actually got in Nursing school but I turned it down), but sometimes ago a friend who is a salesforce analyst sent me a link to code academy where i began practising. It was challenging but I thought to myself why not try and keep trying. My decision has being a work in progress and an encouragement from people of like interest  . 

Right now i am struggling with understanding so many concept and method(at the same time) as they are built off of each other , moreso the higher/deeper you go the more facinated I get about  giving instructions to our computer and different  programs is developed no matter how basic. I have enjoyed each moment having to listen to both Enoch and Howard (my cohort instructors) teach and i must say they are the best . Looking forward and excited about what is ahead.
