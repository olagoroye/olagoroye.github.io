This project is by far the "strongest"  of all the project I have written. React is said to be a javaScript liabriary set for building  user interface . React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

The above took a minute to sink in , has now I will have to forget the ruby syntaxs I was just getting to use/learn about . Thinkinh about my app-- In my previous project I had worked on making a monthly planner app which is actually personal to me but this I wanted a review on my favourite Teas  (lover of Tea).

The first thing you probably want to do is create your backend make sure to include all of your validations , join models, are working properly .You can use postman to try that out (postman is available for Mac download). 

Create two repo's , one for backend and one for frontend - avoid running both is the same file ! Name them accordindly so it help you understand what is going on in each files.

> Run  rails new myappName --api  to generate the backend 


Then you can set up your backend with the neccary rails resource i use `rails scaffold` so I can get the json set up for my frontend . Don't forget to bundle install Rack Corks and set up the origin. You can also seed your database to enable testing .

Frontend Set-Up

>  Run  creact-react-app myappNAme-frontend
 
 yarn install/add react-routers, react-redux, redux thunk, react-booostrap boostrap and every other react liabrairs you would be needing .
 
 
 This set up is just high level but it's enough to get you going on your react-reduv project  , always look at documentation for proper set up.
